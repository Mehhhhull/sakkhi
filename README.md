# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🌸 Sakkhi — Your Companion for Postpartum Healing

> “We ask about the baby. But who asks the mother how she’s doing?”

Sakkhi is **India’s first mother-first emotional wellness platform**, helping postpartum moms track healing through mood, voice, rituals, and community — all in a culturally sensitive, zero-judgment space.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

- 75%+ Indian mothers feel overwhelmed postpartum.  
- 22% suffer from postpartum depression, 80% go undiagnosed.

- Women setting themselves on fire
- Infanticide driven by untreated postpartum psychosis
