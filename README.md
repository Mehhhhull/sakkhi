# 🌸 Sakkhi — Your Companion for Postpartum Healing

> “We ask about the baby. But who asks the mother how she’s doing?”

Sakkhi is **India’s first mother-first emotional wellness platform**, helping postpartum moms track healing through mood, voice, rituals, and community — all in a culturally sensitive, zero-judgment space.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

- 75%+ Indian mothers feel overwhelmed postpartum.  
- 22% suffer from postpartum depression, 80% go undiagnosed.  
- Every digital tool is baby-focused. *No one asks the mother how she’s doing.*

📰 Real stories show the urgency:
- Women setting themselves on fire
- Infanticide driven by untreated postpartum psychosis
- Young Indian mothers silently suffering

What Sakkhi offers:
- Tracks emotional well-being (mood + voice logs)
